# Quick-Note
## OVERVIEW
‘Quick Note’ is a basic text editor app to note down text on your phone and save them in your device for future use. 
The app has very simple features: open the app, create a new file, and start typing, that's it. 
After you finish typing, your content can be saved on your device as a text file. 
The app does not ask for any additional permissions except storage, so you don't have to worry 
about who can see your notes. The app is a place where you can save your ideas, thoughts, experiences, 
notes, keep track of personal & work projects, make lists, or even as a personal diary.    
The app is developed using Android Studio (Java), and so is meant to run on android mobiles. 
The app was inspired by ‘Google Keep’, also a note taking app. The app is most suitable for busy 
people who need to note down things on the fly, since a mobile phone is carried around everywhere it is 
convenient to have a notepad app instead of writing on paper.    
The features of the app are minimalist, they include: creating a new file, opening a text file, save, 
save as, rename, view files, and delete. These are some of the only features available on the app; 
these options are also necessary for easy file handling for the user. Another useful feature in the app 
is the ‘stats’ feature which shows the word count and character count.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The fact that many android phones do not come with a pre-installed app for taking simple notes, 
users tend to look for one in ‘Play Store’. As we have seen, many of the free apps on ‘Play Store’ 
come with ads and also these apps ask for many permissions before the user can use them 
(sometimes due to the features they have), there comes a question of data security. ‘Quick Note’ 
does not come with ads and as for permissions, ask for only storage permission to save the text files on your device.
## FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
We are satisfied with how the app came out, and would like to implement more features in the future. 
Some of the ideas for implementing are:
- At present, this only works for Android version 9 and below. We need to improve this app to run on all the versions.
- Adding templates for different uses, like one for lists, one for diary, and many more.
- Adding a widget feature for implementing alarms, like for meetings.
- Password feature for those secret notes (Diary)
- Memo feature which can display a heading on the home screen for important notes.
- Adding more language support.
- Checklists
- Text to speech feature.
